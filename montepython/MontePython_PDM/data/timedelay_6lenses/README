This directory contains all the files (likelihood,
chains) needed to run a cosmographic analysis with
the H0LiCOW time-delay distance (Dt) and deflector
distance (Dd) measurements of 6 strongly lensed
quasars in MontePython. The implementation has
been tested with MontePython 3.1.0.


To include the H0LiCOW 6-lens data in an existing
MontePython installation, copy the content of the
'data' and 'likelihood' folders to the respective
directories in your MontePython tree. By default,
their paths are:
'your MontePython directory'/data/
'your MontePython directory'/montepython/likelihoods/

Then specify data.experiments=['timedelay_6lenses']
in your parameter file.


If you make use of the H0LiCOW Dd and Dt data,
