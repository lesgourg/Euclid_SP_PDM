# Data on B1608
# the columns are [zd, zs, lambda_d, mu_d, sigma_d, lambda_sft, mu_sft, sigma_sft]
# with zd = lens redhsift 
#      zs = source redhsift
# other three params refer to the shifted lognormal PDF of the time-delay distance,
# as in Suyu et al. 2010 (eq. 35) and 2012 (eq. 26), and the shifted lognormal PDF 
# of the distance to the lens, as in Jee et al. 2019 (eq. S17).
